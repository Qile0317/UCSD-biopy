# UCSD-biopy
scripts I developed for the UCSD bioinformatics course, with a focus on the motif finding problem, with application in finding ori in prokaryota.

```Main.py``` is a disorganized collection of functions and the other 2 python files are application of some of the functions onto sequences.
